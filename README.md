# AcademicProjects: Highlights from 2014

Here are my two biggest projects from my economics program, plus the final output of a long-term research project at the School of Philanthropy. 

## ForecastingPaper
This was a project completed for a class, in conjunction with my work as a research assistant at the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. I created a forecast of aggregate national charitable giving. The README file describes the folder's contents.

## MicroEmpiricalPaper
Work on this project spanned two classes. It's kind of a traditional economics paper, in which I formulate a labor economics hypothesis and test it empirically. Supporting code and data to come.

## GivingBeyondBorders
This was a work project. I was responsible for the statistical analysis part, although I did contribute to the writing and design. Lots of regressions. Again, I'll add data and code at some point. I'll include a copy of the published paper when it arrives!
