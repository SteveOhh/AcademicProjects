> Data: Original dataset used, DO file used to project exogenous variables, resulting dataset

> Analysis: 
>> Models: This is the main show. Static time series regressions were tested in the gusa2013-fcast-an_005 files. 5a2/5b2 are the dynamic forecast models (which produce the graphs as well). Those files use the "forecast" command, which requires Stata 13.
>> Evaluation & Reporting: tests for serial correlation, actfit routine, creation of smearing estimates

> Results: graphs comparing individual and corporate giving forecasts (5 each), plus the actfit evaluation output for those forecasts
